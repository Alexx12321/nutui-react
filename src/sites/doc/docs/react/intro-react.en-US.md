## Compatibility Environment

| Version | Supported Frameworks | Visual Specifications | Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| @nutui/nutui-react <img src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nutui/nutui-react" /> | React 17\18 | Jingdong [APP 10.0](#/resource) | Modern browsers start with Chrome >= 51、iOS >= 10.0 |

For some older versions of browsers, corresponding polyfills are needed. It is recommended to use @babel/preset-env to address browser compatibility issues. The package provided by NutUI-React has not undergone extensive syntax transformation, so it is necessary to include the NutUI-React package in the compilation phase.

For browsers that do not support CSS variables, it is recommended to use [postcss-var-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-var-replace) to resolve compatibility issues.
